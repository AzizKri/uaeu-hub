                    Welcome to UAEU Chat! UAEU Chat is a dynamic social media platform designed to foster communication,
                    collaboration, and community-building, particularly for UAEU students. However, it is important to
                    note that UAEU Chat is not affiliated with the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) in any way.
                    While the platform is catered to UAEU students, it is open for use by anyone who wishes to join, and
                    all users, regardless of their affiliation with the university, are welcome to participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform offers a variety of features to enhance user interaction, including the ability to join
                    communities, post content, comment, and engage in discussions with other users. UAEU Chat also
                    values user privacy and gives you the option to use the platform anonymously. While you can explore
                    and interact with content without creating an account, some features, such as posting or commenting,
                    may require you to register.
                </p>

                    interactions with other users. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from using the
                    platform.

                <p>
                    You must also treat all other users with respect and avoid any behavior that disrupts the experience
                    for others. This includes refraining from personal attacks, abusive behavior, or posting content

                <p>
                    When posting content, you are required to ensure that it is truthful, accurate, and not misleading.
                    You should avoid posting harmful, malicious content or anything that infringes on third-party
                    rights, including intellectual property.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While UAEU Chat allows anonymous use, you must refrain from posting harmful, fraudulent, or
                    deceptive content under the guise of anonymity. Engaging in such activities while remaining
                    anonymous is also prohibited.
                </p>
